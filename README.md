An old walking demo of a Zelda-clone. 

I was digging through my old backup hard drive and found a walking demo of a Zelda clone I wrote back in '99. It's nothing special but it does showcase the use of one of the best tile engine tutorials I'd seen:

Here's a screenshot of the game's world: http://imgur.com/dlivWOF

You start in the top-left. The only other "maps" built into the game at this time are the other two seen here, going down from the start and going right from there.

I've released the code on GPLv3 for anyone who wants to toy with it or learn from it. Happy coding!
